üìå **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project develops a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of Cervical Cancer in patients based on medical attributes such as Demographics: (Age, Number of Sexual Partners, First Sexual Intercourse, Num of Pregnancies), Lifestyle & Risk Factors: (Smokes, Smokes (years), Smokes (packs/year), Hormonal Contraceptives, Hormonal Contraceptives (years), IUD, IUD (years)), Sexually Transmitted Disease (STDs): (STDs, STDs (number), STDs: Condylomatosis, STDs: Vaginal Condylomatosis, STDs: Vulvo-Perineal Condylomatosis, STDs: Syphilis, STDs: Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, STDs: Genital Herpes, STDs: Molluscum Contagiosum, STDs: HIV, STDs: Hepatitis B, STDs: HPV, STDs: Number of Diagnosis, STDs: Time Since First Diagnosis, STDs: Time Since Last Diagnosis) and Target: Diagnosis/Outcome (Dx: Cancer, Dx: HPV, Dx, Hanselmann, Schiller, Cytology, Biopsy)..The goal is to provide a data-driven tool that can support healthcare professionals in early detection and risk assessment of diabetes.

üéØ **OBJECTIVE**

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the Cervical Cancer dataset.

- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations.

- Build, train, and evaluate multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM & Random Forest).

- Select the best-performing model for prediction.

- Deploy the model for real-world usability.
